# Databrary 1.0

Databrary is a digital data library specialized for storing, sharing, and streaming video and audio with a restricted set of institutionally authorized users based on the sharing release level granted by individual research participants.

# Technology stack

Databrary consists of a database in PostgreSQL, a backend framework in Haskell, and a frontend system in Javascript (AngularJS 1.x).
Most users interact with the system via the browser, but a documented API is available (<https://github.com/databrary/route-doc>) for remote client use (e.g., <https://github.com/PLAY-behaviorome/databraryapi>).
The application is hosted on servers at NYU.
The static documentation site is located on a separate server from the application.
The documentation site is generated via Pelican from Markdown.
All code is shared on GitHub: <http://github.com/databrary>.

# Glossary 

See also <https://www.databrary.org/resources/definitions.html>.

- *Volume* or *Volumes*. Collections of data or materials. Databrary assigns all volumes a volume ID, e.g., <https://nyu.databrary.org/volume/1> and all *shared* volumes are granted unique persistent identifiers (DOIs).
- *Session* or *sessions*. Collections of data within a *volume*. A *session* most often represents a single visit by a participant (or set of participants interacting together) in a study and usually refers to a specific combination of locations, people, and tasks where data was collected.
- *Materials*. Components of a *volume* that are not specific to a particular *session*.
- *Slot* or *slot ID*. An identifier used to access a specific *session* or set of *materials*. *Sessions* and *materials* are indexed by a *slot ID*, e.g., <https://nyu.databrary.org/volume/1/slot/6256/-> refers to *slot* 6256 within volume 1. An example of a *slot* containing *materials* is <https://nyu.databrary.org/volume/2/slot/9819/->. Within the *spreadsheet* for a given *volume*, the *slot* or *slot ID* also refers to a *folder* within which multiple files are stored.
- *Folder*. A container with a *volume ID* and *slot ID* that contains *assets*.
- *Asset* or *assets*. Individual files stored within a (*session* or *materials*) *slot* within a *volume*. The files can be of a fixed variety of specified types as specified here: <https://nyu.databrary.org/asset/formats>. For example, the *asset* at <https://nyu.databrary.org/volume/1/slot/9807/-?asset=1> is a simple video file Databrary's development team uses to test the system and its API.
- *Release levels*. The level of access granted to an *asset* and/or *session* by a research participant. Databrary implments a standard set of *release levels* defined here: <https://www.databrary.org/resources/guide/investigators/release/release-levels.html>. Each release level has a unique icon <https://www.databrary.org/resources/guide/investigators/release/release-levels.html>. Every *session* and every *asset* within a *session* is assigned a *release level* of *private* by default. Different *assets* within the same *session* may have different *release levels*.
- *Affiliate*. An individual, affiliated with an *Authorized Investigator* who operates under that *Authorized Investigator's* sponsorship and supervision. The access privileges of *Affiliates* are under the control of one or more *Authorized Investigators*.
- *Authorized investigator*. An individual who has permission from an *Institution* to conduct independent research, who has received authorization through their *Institution* and from Databrary to view, download, and contribute Data. An employee of an Institution who has the background and training in scientific and administrative oversight necessary to conduct and manage research. Institutions determine who may be eligible to conduct independent research, but this typically includes tenure-track faculty (Instructor through Professor, sometimes Emeritus), research or clinical faculty, and may include archivists, curators, and librarians. Research Associates, Research Assistants, and other staff are not considered to be independent investigators, and therefore are not typically granted permission to conduct independent research.
- *Party* or *party ID*. A person or *institution* who either has access to Databrary or can authorize a person to access Databrary (e.g., an institution). For example, <https://nyu.databrary.org/party/12> shows that Penn State is an institution with a *party ID* 12, while <https://nyu.databrary.org/party/249> shows that Kristin Buss is a person with *party ID* 249.
- *Authorized Organizational Representative (AOR)*. The designated individual who is authorized to sign and enter into contractual agreements on behalf of an *Institution*.
- *Collaborator*. A person with read or read/write privileges on a volume. In the Manage Access tab within the Manage Volume page <https://nyu.databrary.org/volume/VOLUME_ID/edit?page=access>, *Collaborator* refers to any person with access to a volume, not just those with read or read/write access.
- *Investigator*. A person with read/write/share/authorship privileges on a *volume*.
- *Volume privileges* or *privileges*. The actions a user is permitted to take on a given *volume*, these include *read* (view and download *assets*), *read/write* (view, download *assets*, upload or edit *assets*, edit volume *metadata*), and *read/write/share* (view, download *assets*, upload or edit *assets*, edit volume *metadata*, edit access to the *volume* by others, have name included among authors in the bibligraphic citation generated for the volume).

# Access model

## Sponsor model

Databrary employs a *sponsor* model, where specific *parties* can grant access privileges to other *parties*.
For example, when an individual institution signs the *Databrary Access Agreement* for the first time, Databrary becomes a sponsor of that institution.
That institution, in turn, becomes a sponsor of a specific *Authorized Investigator* who is employed by and approved by the institution.
Subsequently, *Authorized Investigators* may choose to *sponsor* (grant access privileges to) other *Authorized Investigators* or *Affiliates*.

## Authorized Investigator privileges

*Authorized Investigators* are automatically granted (read/download) access to all *shared* data and materials on Databrary.
*Authorized Investigators* may also create new volumes, read/write/edit/change access to volumes.
On a volume-by-volume basis, *Authorized Investigators* choose who is a *collaborator* (view/read or view/read/write privileges) and who is an *investigator* (view/read/write/authorship/share privileges).
*Authorized Investigators* also choose whether or not each *Affiliate* has (read/download) privileges on Databrary.
